## Search criteria

The first step in reviews is to gather a sample of records. This initial procedure is the foundation for the entire meta-analytical process: if the goal is to aggregate all the available data on a given topic, the primary pool must contain all of it. At the same time, the sample should be concise enough to optimise the work flow. Upon selecting the online databases, we attempted to do a "term" search, based on a set of words we scouted from the distributive politics literature we already knew. This search produced oversized databases, of which a large share was completely unrelated to our subject of investigation. The strategy we found to be the most thorough and productive was to select the records that cited Weingast, Shepsle and Johnsen's 1981 paper "The political economy of benefits and costs: A neoclassical approach to distributive politics". Although \href{https://scholar.google.com/}{Google Scholar} reports the article amounts to \href{https://scholar.google.com/scholar?um=1&ie=UTF-8&lr&cites=13117579863846712459}{2,180} citations\footnote{As of May 11\textsuperscript{th}, 2020.}, as of the 21\textsuperscript{st} of November 2019, our search resulted in a total of 2,664 records.

We webscraped the main databases in Social Sciences: \href{https://scholar.google.com/}{Google Scholar} (n = 1001); \href{https://academic.microsoft.com/home}{Microsoft Academic} (n = 927); and
\href{https://www.scopus.com/}{Scopus} (n = 736). The R script we wrote extracted, to a .csv file, the title, abstract, authors, year, journal of publication, and database from which the record originated. We screened these results with an English language and Article restriction -- meaning, we excluded all records written in other languages and all that were not academic papers, such as book chapters, doctoral theses, etc. We set no restriction to unpublished articles.

Below, you will find the webscrape script:

## Article Selection

The selection process was conducted by two authors in three phases. In the first round, we excluded all titles that were obviously unrelated to our topic of investigation. For instance, we curiously found articles about automobile motors amidst our sample. We consider this a preliminary step, since we were not able to eliminate a large number of entries. Thus, we read all abstracts. We chose to maintain those that indicated either government expenditure or legislative structures were central matters. For instance, if the paper sought to identify variables that increased government size, it was maintained. Abstracts that indicated the paper discussed or estimated the impacts of representative institutions, elections, or chamber dynamics, for example, were also included. This allowed us to significantly reduce our sample to 376 records.

In the second phase, we assessed full-texts. To proceed, the paper should (i) conduct a quantitative analysis, (ii) report data on the number of legislators, and (iii) also on public expenditure. If the record was marked as positive for all three, it was maintained. Disagreements in this phase were discussed among the authors, and a third was consulted when needed.

The third phase consisted of filling out tables for each of the remaining 50 articles to systematically evaluate their eligibility. Since government spending and the number of parliamentaries assume the form of different variables, we extracted the coefficients that provided this information in all papers, indicating and defining which variables each author used. By observing what is most commonly used, we could decide which variables we would employ in our analysis. In this phase, we also collected information on whether or not the paper had been published, and if it explicitly discussed the \textit{law of 1/n}. Upon choosing the variables, we excluded the non-conforming studies, arriving at our final sample of 26 articles.

#### Exclusion analysis

We selected the final pool of articles based on two criteria regarding their reported coefficients:

1. Matched treatment variable:
  + N: Number Legislators Lower House
  + logN: Log Number Legislators Lower House
  + K: Number Legislators Upper House
  
2. Matched outcome variable:
  + ExpPC: Expenditure Per Capita
  + logExpPC: Log Expenditure Per Capita
  + PCTGDP: Percent GDP Public Expenditure

### Flow Chart

We visually organised the flow of articles across eligibility phases through this diagram\footnote{According to the \href{www.prisma-statement.org/}{PRISMA} statement for reporting meta-analyses and systematic reviews}. The column to the right depicts the amount of articles excluded in each phase, and the one to the left shows the number of records evaluated.

## Meta-analysis dataset

The meta-analytic data is comprised of two datasets. The first dataset has the main coefficients that were reported in the paper. It includes only the most rigorous model from each paper, that is, those estimated with the largest $n$, most control variables, and fixed effects if the authors added them. If the article employed a regression discontinuity design, we chose the coefficient from the optimal bandwidth or from the intermediate one. This sample encompasses 36 estimates, as 10 articles analysed two dependent or independent variables of interest.  Our second sample, in contrast, contains all the 126 effect sizes reported in the 26 papers. 

In the main text, we focus on the results for our restricted sample as we consider them more robust, but the findings are very similar when we use the extended set. Below is the data extraction process for all relevant coefficients in the selected articles. In the \@ref(meta-an) and \@ref(meta-reg) sections of this Appendix, you will find all tests performed in both reduced and full samples.

### Descriptive Statistics of Moderators

We chose a set of moderators that frequently appear in the literature and may help us interpret our results. We included them in our meta-regressions alongside an indicator for the type of independent variable used in the original study ($n$, log($n$), or $k$). The additional moderators are: 1) electoral system; 2) data aggregation level; 3) estimation method; 4) publication year; 5) paper publication in an academic journal. The table below presents descriptive statistics for these moderators in our selection of articles.

```{r, echo=F,warning=F,message=F}
fulldat$usemeta2 <- factor(fulldat$usemeta)
levels(fulldat$usemeta2) <- c('Other Coefficients', 'Main Coefficients')
aux <- select(fulldat, usemeta2, indepvar2, year, published, 
              elecsys2, method, agglevel, location2) %>%
  rename(`Independent Variables` = indepvar2,
         `Year` = year, 
         `Published work` = published, 
         `Electoral system` = elecsys2, 
         `Estimation method` = method, 
         `Sampling Aggregation Level` = agglevel, 
         `Sample Location` = location2)

export2md(descrTable(~.-usemeta2, aux, y = aux$usemeta2, 
                        show.p.overall = F, show.all = T),
          caption = "Descriptive Statistics of Moderators")
```



### Binomial Tests for Coefficient Signs

A general test of the theory would be to study whether the coefficients are positive or negative. Note that the law of 1/n poses we should have a positive influence of legislature size on expenditure. To test this theory, we run a Binomial One-Proportion Z-test. The test consists in contrasting the number of occurences of positive and negative signs (Binomial trials) against the hypothesis that they were produced with 0.5 percent chance. Note that if this is the case, any detected difference would be a mere XXXX of chance.

For the number of legislators in the lower house (N), the results follow below.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
aux <- filter(dat, indepvar2=='N')
binom.test(table(aux$scoef)[2], sum(table(aux$scoef)), p=0.5, alternative = 'greater')
```

Therefore, the most elementary test we could run, a sign direction test, tells us that the law of 1/n does not hold for our sample. For the log of the number of legislators in the lower house (log(N)), the results follow below.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
aux <- filter(dat, indepvar2=='logN')
binom.test(table(aux$scoef)[2], sum(table(aux$scoef)), p=0.5, alternative = 'greater')
```

For log(N), although most coefficients were negative, there are very few studies, making the Finally, for the number of legislators in the upper house (K), the results follow below.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
aux <- filter(dat, indepvar2=='K')
binom.test(table(aux$scoef)[2], sum(table(aux$scoef)), p=0.5, alternative = 'greater')
```

Here, the law of 1/n holds. However, the effect goes in a direction different from the predicted in the law of k/n paper.

### Electoral system x Sign Coefficient

```{r, echo=FALSE}

chisq.test(table(dat$scoef, dat$elecsys2), simulate.p.value = T)

### Independent Variable x Sign Coefficient

```{r, echo=FALSE}

## Meta-analysis {#meta-an}

We combined the three independent (N, logN, and K) with the levels of the three dependent variables (ExpPC, logExpPC, PCTGDP). This formed a 3x3 possibility for our analysis.


### ExpPC x N

Highlights:

1. The results are highly heterogeneous: $I^2 = $ `r round(mod$I2*100, 2)`.
2. The Random effects modem SMD estimated is $g = $ `r round(mod$TE.random,2)` ($SE =$ `r round(mod$seTE.random,3)`).
3. The prediction interval ranges from `r round(mod$lower.predict,2)` to `r round(mod$upper.predict,2)`. Therefore, it `r ifelse(((mod$lower.predict)*(mod$upper.predict))>0,'does not emcompasses zero.','emcompasses zero.')`

#### Electoral system subgroup analysis

The law of 1/n was created for majoritarian systems. In the theoretical section below, we explain why the argument have potential issues when applied to non-majoritarian electoral systems. We estimated a subgroup analysis using a binary electoral system.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, fig.cap="Subgroup Analysis of (N) x (ExpPC), controlling by electoral system",warning=FALSE}
mod <- update(mod, byvar = aux$elecsys2, print.byvar = F)

mod2 <- tibble(
  TE = mod$TE,
  seTE = mod$seTE,
  studlab = mod$studlab,
  lower = mod$lower,
  upper = mod$upper,
  group = "A") %>%
  bind_rows(.,
            aux = tibble(
              TE = c(mod$TE.random, NA),
              seTE = c(mod$seTE.random, NA),
              studlab = c("Overall Effect", "Prediction Interval"),
              lower = c(mod$lower.random, mod$lower.predict),
              upper = c(mod$upper.random, mod$upper.predict),
              group = "B")) %>%
  group_by(studlab) %>%
  mutate(studlab2 = paste0(studlab, "_", 1:n())) %>%
  ungroup()


f1b <- mod2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = reorder(studlab2,TE), x = TE, xmin = lower, xmax = upper)) +
  # Studies coefs
  geom_point(aes(color = group)) +
  # Error Bars
  geom_errorbarh(aes(color = group), height = 0.1) +
  # Colors
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#000000", "#8b0000")) + 
  # X-axis limit
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(1.2*(min(mod2$lower)), 1.2*(max(mod2$upper)))) +
  # Y-axis names
  scale_y_discrete(labels = function(x) str_replace(x, "_[0-9]*$", "")) + 
  # Vertical dashed line
  geom_vline(xintercept=0, color="#000000", linetype="dashed") +
  # Labels
  labs(x = "",
       y = "") + 
  # Facet - Separating Studies from Overall Effect
  facet_grid(group~., scales = "free", space = "free") + 
  # Theme
  theme_minimal() %+replace%
  theme(strip.text.y = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "none",
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 15, hjust = 1.1),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 15, hjust = 1.1)) 

f1b
```

Therefore, we can see that the hypothesis that majoritarian systems produce systematic positive effects was disproved. The majoritarian systems in the sample had a random effects model estimate of -0.25, while the random effects model in the non-majoritarian subgroup fitted a value of 0.08. Both are non-significant, but they reassure us that the absense of effect is not caused by pooling multiple types of electoral systems.

### ExpPC x logN

There were no studies that had per capita expenditure in the dependent variable and log of lower house size in the treatment variable.

#### Electoral system subgroup analysis

The law of 1/n was created for majoritarian systems. In the theoretical section below, we explain why the argument have potential issues when applied to non-majoritarian electoral systems. We estimated a subgroup analysis using a binary electoral system.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, fig.cap="Subgroup Analysis of (N) x (ExpPC), controlling by electoral system",warning=FALSE}
mod2 <- tibble(
  TE = mod$TE,
  seTE = mod$seTE,
  studlab = mod$studlab,
  lower = mod$lower,
  upper = mod$upper,
  group = "A") %>%
  bind_rows(.,
            aux = tibble(
              TE = c(mod$TE.random, NA),
              seTE = c(mod$seTE.random, NA),
              studlab = c("Overall Effect", "Prediction Interval"),
              lower = c(mod$lower.random, mod$lower.predict),
              upper = c(mod$upper.random, mod$upper.predict),
              group = "B")) %>%
  group_by(studlab) %>%
  mutate(studlab2 = paste0(studlab, "_", 1:n())) %>%
  ungroup()

f8b <- mod2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = reorder(studlab2,TE), x = TE, xmin = lower, xmax = upper)) +
  # Studies coefs
  geom_point(aes(color = group)) +
  # Error Bars
  geom_errorbarh(aes(color = group), height = 0.1) +
  # Colors

  # Vertical dashed line

        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 15, hjust = 1.1)) 
f8b
```

Therefore, we can see that the hypothesis that majoritarian systems produce systematic positive effects was disproved. The majoritarian systems in the sample had a random effects model estimate of -0.25, while the random effects model in the non-majoritarian subgroup fitted a value of 0.08. Both are non-significant, but they reassure us that the absense of effect is not caused by pooling multiple types of electoral systems.

### logExpPC x logN

In this specification, we study the log of per capita expenditure (logExpPC) as a function of the log of lower house size (logN).

  model = "PCTGDP"
) %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, list(~round(., digits = 4)))


```

```{r}
summary(mod)
```

As we have considerable heterogeneity in our sample, we run a permutation test to ensure the validity of our estimates. The results follow below.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
mod <- permutest(mod, progbar = F)
mod

mod1_permu <- tibble(
     ` ` = c("Intercept", "Indepvar: N", "Indepvar: logN", "Year", "Published: No",
          "Elecsys: Non-Majoritarian", "Method: Panel", "AggLevel: States", "Location: World"),
  Estimate = mod[["beta"]],
  SE = mod[["se"]],
  `T` = mod[["zval"]],
  `P-Value` = mod[["pval"]],
  CI = paste0("(", round(mod[["ci.lb"]], digits = 4), " ; ",
              round(mod[["ci.ub"]], digits = 4 ), ")"),
  model = "PCTGDP - Permutation"
) %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, list(~round(., digits = 3))) 


```


We have the following results for the meta-regressions of Expenditure Per Capita:

1. Compared with `K`, models with `N` and `logN` find significantly negative coefficients.
2. Year has null effect.
3. Unpublished papers tend to have higher coefficients than published papers.
4. Passing from `Majoritarian` to `Non-Majoritarian`, decreases significantly the effects found in our models.
5. In terms of the modeling, passing from `OLS` to `PANEL` increases the detected effects.
6. When passing from `Local` to `State` or `World` levels, it decreases the detected effect size.

Below we also run the meta-regressions adding all coefficients in the papers. The results follow below:

```{r, echo=F, warning=F}
mod <- rma(yi = coef, 
              sei = SE, 
              data = fulldat, 
              method = "REML", 
              mods = ~ indepvar2+year+published+elecsys2+method+agglevel+location2, 
              test = "knha",
            subset = fulldat$depvar2=='PCTGDP',
            slab = fulldat$authoryear)

mod2 <- tibble(
  ` ` = c("Intercept", "Indepvar: N", "Indepvar: logN", "Year", "Published: No",
          "Elecsys: Non-Majoritarian", "Method: Panel", "AggLevel: States", "Location: World"),
  Estimate = mod[["beta"]],
  SE = mod[["se"]],
  `T` = mod[["zval"]],
  `P-Value` = mod[["pval"]],
  CI = paste0("(", round(mod[["ci.lb"]], digits = 4), " ; ",
              round(mod[["ci.ub"]], digits = 4 ), ")"),
  model = "PCTGDP - All coefs"
) %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, list(~round(., digits = 3))) 

```

```{r}
summary(mod)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

mod <- permutest(mod, progbar = F)
mod 

mod2_permu <- tibble(
     ` ` = c("Intercept", "Indepvar: N", "Indepvar: logN", "Year", "Published: No",
          "Elecsys: Non-Majoritarian", "Method: Panel", "AggLevel: States", "Location: World"),
  Estimate = mod[["beta"]],
  SE = mod[["se"]],
  `T` = mod[["zval"]],
  `P-Value` = mod[["pval"]],
  CI = paste0("(", round(mod[["ci.lb"]], digits = 4), " ; ",
              round(mod[["ci.ub"]], digits = 4 ), ")"),
  model = "PCTGDP - All coefs - Permutation"
) %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, list(~round(., digits = 3))) 

```


For all the coefficients, we have the following results:

1. Compared with `K`, models with `N` and `logN` tend to have significantly negative coefficients.
2. Year has a positive effect: the younger the publication, the higher the detected coefficient.
3. Unpublished papers tend to have higher coefficients than published papers.
4. Passing from `Majoritarian` to `Non-Majoritarian`, decreases significantly the effects found in our models.
5. In terms of the modeling, passing from `OLS` to `PANEL` increases the detected effects.
6. When passing from `Local` to `State` or `World` levels, it decreases the detected effect size.

As we have considerable heterogeneity in our sample, we run a permutation test to ensure the validity of our estimates. The results follow below.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
mod <- permutest(mod, progbar = F)
mod 

mod3_permu <- tibble(
  ` ` = c("Intercept", "Indepvar: N", "Year", "Elecsys: Non-Majoritarian", "Method: Panel",
          "Method: IV", "AggLevel: States"),
  Estimate = mod[["beta"]],
  SE = mod[["se"]],
  `T` = mod[["zval"]],
  `P-Value` = mod[["pval"]],
  CI = paste0("(", round(mod[["ci.lb"]], digits = 4), " ; ",
              round(mod[["ci.ub"]], digits = 4 ), ")"),
  model = "ExpPC - Permutation"
) %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, list(~round(., digits = 3))) 

```


We have the following results for the meta-regressions of Expenditure Per Capita:

1. Compared with `K`, models with `N` tend to detect significantly smaller effects.
2. Year has null effect.
3. Passing the electoral rules from `Majoritarian` to `Non-Majoritarian`, increases significantly the per capita expenditure found in our models.
4. In terms of the modeling, passing from `OLS` to `PANEL` or `IV` increases the detected effects.
5. When passing from `Local` to `State` level, decreases the detected effects.

Below we also run the meta-regressions adding all coefficients in the papers. The results follow below:

```{r, echo=F, warning=F}
mod <- rma(yi = coef, 
              sei = SE, 
              data = fulldat, 
              method = "REML", 
              mods = ~ indepvar2+year+published+elecsys2+method+agglevel+location2, 
              test = "knha",
            subset = fulldat$depvar2=='ExpPC',
            slab = fulldat$authoryear)

mod4 <- tibble(
  ` ` = c("Intercept", "Indepvar: N", "Year", "Elecsys: Non-Majoritarian",
             "Method: Panel", "Method: IV" ,"AggLevel: States"),
  Estimate = mod[["beta"]],
  SE = mod[["se"]],
  `T` = mod[["zval"]],
  `P-Value` = mod[["pval"]],
  CI = paste0("(", round(mod[["ci.lb"]], digits = 4), " ; ",
              round(mod[["ci.ub"]], digits = 4 ), ")"),
  model = "ExpPC - All coefs"
) %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, list(~round(., digits = 3))) 

```

```{r}
summary(mod)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

mod <- permutest(mod, progbar = F)
mod


mod4_permu <- tibble(
  ` ` = c("Intercept", "Indepvar: N", "Year", "Elecsys: Non-Majoritarian",
             "Method: Panel", "Method: IV" ,"AggLevel: States"),
  Estimate = mod[["beta"]],
  SE = mod[["se"]],
  `T` = mod[["zval"]],
  `P-Value` = mod[["pval"]],
  CI = paste0("(", round(mod[["ci.lb"]], digits = 4), " ; ",
              round(mod[["ci.ub"]], digits = 4 ), ")"),
  model = "ExpPC - All coefs - Permutation"
) %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, list(~round(., digits = 3))) 

```

With all coefficients, the results of the effect sizes on the Expenditure Per Capita Regressions are the following:

1. Compared with `K`, models with `N` tend to detect significantly smaller effects.
2. Year has now a positive effect on coefficient sizes.
3. Passing the electoral rules from `Majoritarian` to `Non-Majoritarian`, increases significantly the effects on per capita expenditure found in our models.
4. In terms of the modeling, passing from `OLS` to `PANEL` decreases the detected effects.
5. All other coeffients were not significant.

## Theory of Meta Analysis


There are two main estimators for conducting meta analysis: fixed effects and random effects models. The fixed effects model assumes that there is one true effect in reality, and that all estimates are an attempt to uncover this true effect. The random effects model, on the other hand, assumes that there are a distribution of true effects, that vary based on sample and tests characteristics.

In this paper, we use the random effects model. The empirical papers testing the law of 1/n are very diverse. We tried to capture some of this diversity by considering the main dependent and independent variables separately, but they have at least three other important sources of dispersion:

1. **Subjects**: Counties, Municipalities, States, Provinces, Countries.
2. **Electoral systems**: Majoritarian, PR, Mixed.
3. **Modeling strategies**: Panel data, Standard OLS, IV, RDD.

These sources of heterogeneity have two implications. First, it makes our estimates very disperse. The heterogeneity tests are all but one significant. When the sample sizes are large enough, we removed more heterogeneous studies, but we still had considerable dispersion in our estimates. Second, the amount of heterogeneity makes fixed effects estimates unrealistic and bised. Thus, we opt for random effects model.

Let each study having an effect of $T_i$. In a random effects model, we can decompose this effect in two components, the true effect that the study with the same specifications as $i$ come from, $\theta_i$, and a within-study error $\varepsilon_i$:

\[
T_i \ = \ \theta_i + \varepsilon_i
\]

And the random effects model assumes that the $\theta_i$ varies from study to study, having a true parameter $\mu$, plus a between-study error, $\xi_i$:

\[
T_i \ = \ \mu + \xi_i + \varepsilon_i
\]

And the random effects model estimates the parameter $\mu$, under the challenge of estimating both the within-and-between-study sampling errors.

In all empirical estimates, we use the package `meta`, and the package `dmetar`, described in (Doing Meta-Analysis with R)[https://bookdown.org/MathiasHarrer/Doing_Meta_Analysis_in_R/random.html]. To empirically implement the random effects model, we need to choose a method to estimate the true effect size variance, $\tau^2$, which in our formulation, represents the variance of $\xi_i$. We selected the **Restricted Maximum Likelihood Estimator**, as the literature regards it as more precise when we have continuous measures, such as we have on our data (link)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26332144].

## Robustness: Full model meta-regressions combined {#full-meta-reg}

In this section, we aggregate all the coefficients and run a multivariate meta-regression, controlling by:

1. The type of the dependent variable in the study (expenditure per capita, log of the expenditure per capita, and share of government expenditure in the GDP)
2. The type of the independent variable in the stydy (N, K, log of N);
3. The electoral system (Majoritarian, Proportional Representation, and Mixed).

The results follow below, and show null effect for all variables, including the intercept.

```{r, echo=F, warning=F}
mod <-  rma(yi = coef, 
              sei = SE, 
              data = dat, 
              method = "REML", 
              mods = ~ depvar2+indepvar2+year+published+elecsys2+method+agglevel+location2, 
              test = "knha")
```

```{r}
summary(mod)
```

As we have considerable heterogeneity in our sample, we run a permutation test to ensure the validity of our estimates. The results follow below.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
permutest(mod, progbar = F)
```

In the main text, we selected the coefficients based on the regressions that had most observations and that presented a full model (with fixed effects or intermediate bandwidth in RDD). Below we also run the meta-regressions adding all coefficients in the papers. The results follow below:

```{r, echo=F, warning=F}
mod <- rma(yi = coef, 
              sei = SE, 
              data = fulldat, 
              method = "REML", 
              mods = ~ depvar2+indepvar2+year+published+elecsys2+method+agglevel+location2, 
              test = "knha")
```

```{r}
summary(mod)
```

```{r}
permutest(mod, progbar = F)
```
